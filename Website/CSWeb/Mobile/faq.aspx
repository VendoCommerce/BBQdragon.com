          <div class="faqanswer" id="faq1">

          <div class="faqanswer" id="faq1">
             <p>BBQ competitors love BBQ Dragon, but they love it for the same reason you will: it slashes grill heat-up time so you can get down to the real business of BBQ!

   </div>    
   
           <a href="#faq4" class="togglefaq"><i class="icon-plus"></i> Isn't a gas grill a better way to BBQ?</a>
          <div class="faqanswer" id="faq1">
             <p>Not if you love flavor. Experts agree that charcoal lends a flavor that is unparalleled by gas grills, which provide only heat, and with BBQ Dragon, your charcoal grill's heat is far superior to a gas grill.

    <a href="#faq8" class="togglefaq"><i class="icon-plus"></i> How long do the batteries last?</a>
          <div class="faqanswer" id="faq1">
             <p>We designed the BBQ Dragon to last for nearly an hour on high speed, and almost two full hours at a medium speed no less than an hour on medium-high speed. That way with average use, you should be able to start 6 – 8 fires.
</p>
   </div>         
    <a href="#faq9" class="togglefaq"><i class="icon-plus"></i> Can I recharge the included alkaline batteries?</a>
          <div class="faqanswer" id="faq1">
             <p>NO! The BBQ Dragon was designed to be rechargeable but do not recharge the alkaline batteries that are included. Purchase the BBQ Dragon Power Kit
</p>
   </div>   

    <a href="#faq10" class="togglefaq"><i class="icon-plus"></i> Won't it melt?</a>
          <div class="faqanswer" id="faq1">
             <p>No, not if it is used correctly. We have carefully designed the BBQ Dragon so that it can withstand the heat of a barbeque grill – within reason. The handles are positioned on the outside of the grill so that they stay cool to the touch. The Dragon is designed to draw  cool air from OUTSIDE of the grill onto the coals to provide oxygen and ignite the coals fast. If, however, the Dragon is positioned in such a way that is drawing in hot air from the grill, it could damage the unit. Do not position the Dragon directly over the coals! Always make sure the Dragon is drawing in cool air, and it will stay cool and not cause any damage. As with any BBQ accessory, care should be taken so a not to burn yourself or others.
</p>

      <a href="#faq10" class="togglefaq"><i class="icon-plus"></i> What happens if my grill starts so fast that it is ready before my guests arrive?</a>
          <div class="faqanswer" id="faq1">
             <p>Cook up some appetizers! This is a real possibility. Soon you will be used to how quickly you can start a charcoal grill, and you will use it a lot more that you do now! It will open up a whole new world of charcoal grilling.

      <a href="#faq11" class="togglefaq"><i class="icon-plus"></i> Will the BBQ Dragon work on my Big Green Egg?</a>
          <div class="faqanswer" id="faq1">
             <p>Yes! We specifically designed the Dragon so that it will clip on the side of a Big Green Egg, as well as may other grills, smokers and fire pits.
