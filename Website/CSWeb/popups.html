<p><strong>What Does This Warranty Cover?</strong><br>
This warranty covers any manufacturing defects or malfunctions in your new BBQ Dragon.</p>
<p><strong>How Long Does The Coverage Last?</strong><br>
This warranty lasts for two (2) years from the date you purchased your BBQ Dragon. Coverage terminates if you sell or otherwise transfer ownership of the Device. Proof of purchase required.</p>

BBQ Dragon will, at their discretion, repair or replace your BBQ Dragon. You must pay shipping charges.</p>

Batteries, battery damage, or any problem that is caused by abuse, misuse, or an act of God (such as a flood) are not covered. Damage caused by heat is not covered. Damage from dropping, submersion, or other mistreatment is not covered. Lost parts are not covered. BBQ Dragons that have been serviced or dissembled by the consumer are not covered. Also, consequential and incidental damages are not recoverable under this warranty. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.</p>
